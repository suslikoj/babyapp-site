# **Phase 1 of the elimination diet – main suspects**

In this phase, you **begin the elimination diet in a systematic and
targeted way**.  
The goal is not to eliminate as many foods as possible, but to
temporarily **remove those that most commonly cause problems** and
observe how the child’s body responds.

## What comes next?

During this phase, you will eliminate the following foods from the diet:

- milk and all dairy products

- eggs

- soy

- beef

- poultry

At the same time, you will exclude all products that contain these
ingredients, including their hidden forms (e.g., whey, casein, soy
flour, soy grits, etc.).

Traces of allergens are not addressed at this stage—the actual
ingredients of foods are what matter.

## How long does the phase last?

This phase lasts 14 days.  
For some children, it may be appropriate to continue slightly longer,
but no more than 1 month.

During this period, you monitor changes in the child’s health,
especially:

- skin condition (eczema),

- digestion,

- overall comfort of the child.

## What are the important guidelines for this phase?

- Do not try to “invent replacements at all costs.”

- Maintain as much variety as possible within the allowed foods.

- Focus on simple, clear meals and fresh ingredients.

- Do not restrict food intake; ensure sufficient nutrient intake—this is
  the top priority.

The goal of this phase is not long-term elimination, but gaining clear
answers.

## What should you expect after this phase?

After completing this phase, we will evaluate together how the child’s
condition has changed.

- If there is a significant improvement in symptoms, you will continue
  to the allergen testing phase, where eliminated foods are gradually
  and safely reintroduced to precisely identify what causes problems for
  the child.

- If symptoms do not improve at all or only minimally, this suggests
  that the trigger is likely not limited to the main suspects. In that
  case, the app will automatically suggest continuing to **phase 2 of
  the elimination diet – complete elimination**.

## What does complete elimination look like in practice?

The complete elimination phase is the next systematic step.  
Its goal is to:

- remove less common but still possible allergens.

This phase is shorter. Allergens are reintroduced after a few days, and
it is evaluated which of them are truly problematic.

## How does the app support you?

During these 14 days, you will complete simple daily tasks that help
you:

- understand the principles of the elimination diet,

- avoid common mistakes,

- gain confidence that you are following the diet correctly,

- get tips for safe recipes,

- have support and a clear step-by-step structure.

The app guides you through the entire phase in a practical way.
