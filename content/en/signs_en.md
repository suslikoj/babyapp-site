# **Symptoms of food allergy**

### How can you recognize it?

A food allergy can show up in many different ways. In some children,
reactions are fast and obvious; in others, they are subtle and delayed.
Every child can react differently, but there are typical signs that
suggest a food is causing a problem.

They are often mistaken for:

- reflux

- a sensitive stomach

- teething

- a cold

This article summarizes symptoms **in both breastfed and non-breastfed**
children and will help you better understand what is happening in your
child’s body.

### Symptoms of allergy in breastfed babies

In breastfed babies, allergens reach the baby **through breast milk**.
Reactions are therefore **often milder, slower, and harder to
recognize**.

**Typical symptoms:**

**Skin**

- worsening eczema (within 24–48 hours)

- red patches

- itching

- weeping eczema—this does not necessarily mean an infection right away,
  but may reflect a larger amount of allergen in the body that the body
  is trying to eliminate

**Stool**

- mucus

- greenish stools

- more frequent diarrhea

- **streaks of blood in very young babies**

- sour-smelling stool

**Belly**

- colic

- bloated belly

- crying after feeding

- frequent gas

- reflux (forceful vomiting or excessive spit-up)

**Behavior and sleep**

- restlessness

- frequent waking

- “inconsolable crying”

### **Symptoms of allergy in non-breastfed and older children**

The child reacts directly to the food they ate. Reactions may be
**immediate (IgE) or delayed (non-IgE).**

##### Immediate IgE-mediated allergic reactions

They usually occur **within minutes up to 2 hours** after eating.

Typical fast symptoms:

- **hives**

- flushing/redness

- body itching

- swelling of the lips, eyelids, or tongue

- sudden vomiting

- stomach pain

- diarrhea

- wheezing, coughing, or difficulty breathing

##### **Most dangerous form: anaphylaxis**

It starts suddenly and progresses quickly (within minutes). It may
include:

- full-body hives

- severe swelling

- shortness of breath

- vomiting and diarrhea

- weakness, paleness, fainting

Fast reactions are always serious and require medical attention.

##### **Delayed non-IgE reactions**

They may appear **8 hours to several days** after eating the food.

Typical delayed symptoms:

Skin

- worsening eczema

- itchy patches

- redness

Digestion

- stomach pain

- bloating

- mucus in stool

- blood in stool

- loose or frequent stools

- reflux

- vomiting 1–3 hours after eating

General symptoms

- the baby is restless

- poor sleep

- refusal to eat

Delayed allergies are often not detected by standard tests.

##### **Local contact reactions to food**

Some children react even when the food touches the skin.

Different foods may cause:

- redness

- small bumps

- itching

These reactions are not dangerous, but they indicate sensitivity. They
also may not immediately mean a true food allergy and can be
contact-related only.

### How can I tell if it is truly an allergy?

✔ **A combination of symptoms**  
Skin + belly + stool is a common allergy pattern.

✔ **The reactions repeat**

✔ **Improvement after eliminating the food**  
If the child feels better when the food is avoided.

✔ **Worsening after reintroduction**  
This confirms the cause.

##### How to avoid confusing allergy with intolerance?

**Intolerance is not an allergy.** (for example, celiac disease or
lactose intolerance).

Typical for intolerance:

- bloating

- gas

- stomach pain

- the reaction depends on the amount

With allergy, it is an inflammatory immune response—not an enzyme
deficiency, which is typical for intolerance.

##### When should You see a doctor?

- blood in stool

- poor weight gain

- severe colic during the day and night

- vomiting after every meal

- swelling, wheezing, or shortness of breath

- repeated hives

- severe worsening of eczema

##### Key takeaways:

- Allergy can have **fast, slow, or combined** symptoms.

- Infants often react through breast milk, mainly with eczema and
  digestive symptoms.

- Fast (IgE) reactions are obvious and dangerous.

- Delayed (non-IgE) reactions are common but harder to detect.

- The best way to confirm is a structured **elimination–challenge
  approach**.

- Tests reliably detect only IgE allergies.
